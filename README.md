Playable State: SURVIVAL

You are a little pink circle. If you touch Life, you fail. Outside of your starting area, Life cells initialize randomly, then develop according to their rules. They'll eventually stagnate, which is kind of like winning. Your yellow hurtbox is visible for testing and clarity.

Life, written in vanilla Javascript for web consumption. Will run slowly on some systems. Also contains death.

You are a little pink circle. If you touch Life or run out of time, you die. Eliminate 'Fruit Cells' by firing Life diagonally at them. Each FC is worth 1 point and 15 ticks of time. See how high you can get your score!
